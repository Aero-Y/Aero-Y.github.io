# Moving Efficiently  Command Line 
## Stop Using left/right arrow keys to move around in the command line
It is really uncomfortable and not efficient using `left arrow` or `right arrow`  keys to move cursor in the command line.  Forming a good habit of using keyboard shortcut will definitely save me a lot of time in the long term even through I sometimes forget the shortcuts and hope to turn back to the most intuitive and cumbersome operations. 
## High Frequency Used 
- move the cursor to the start of the line `Ctrl`+`a`
- move the cursor to the start of the line `Ctrl`+`e`
- clear entire line `Ctrl`+`u`
-   `Ctrl + l`  â€” Clear screen
- move forward a word. `Alt` + `f`
- move backward a word.  `Alt`  +  `b`
-   Cut from cursor to the end of line.  `Ctrl`  +  `k`
-   Cut from cursor to the end of word.  `Alt`  +  `d`
-   Cut from cursor to the start of word.  `Alt`  +  `Backspace`
