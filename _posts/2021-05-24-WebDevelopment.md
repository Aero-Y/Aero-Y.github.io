# Web Development Diary 

I need an **website to record** my daily progress in **academic** and **Tokyo life** during the Phd, choosing a theme at hand is a good idea. 
But i need more freedom on page layout and page behavior, so I choose to to develop myself anyway. 

I will start from learning the basic structure of Html, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- **HTML** provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified my other technologies like CSS adn JavaScript. 
- **CSS** is used to control presentation, formating, and layout. 
- **JavaScript** is used to control the behavior of different elements. 


HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. "Markup language" means that, rather than using a programming language to perform functions, **HTML uses tags** to identify different types of **content** and the **purposes** they each serve to the webpage.

An `HTML element` is defined by a `start tag, some content, and an end tag`:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title> My first page</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1> My first heading </h1>
<p>My first paragraph </p>
</body>
</html>
```
The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.

The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page.

The `<head>` element contains meta information about the HTML page.

The `<title>` element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab).

The `<body>` element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

In HTML, spaces and new lines are ignored, if you want to change line, you should use `<br>`. 

The HTML style attribute has the following syntax: 

```
<tagname style="property:value;">
```
